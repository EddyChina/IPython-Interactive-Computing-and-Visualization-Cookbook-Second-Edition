# IPython Interactive Computing and Visualization Cookbook - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [IPython Interactive Computing and Visualization Cookbook - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/ipython-interactive-computing-and-visualization-cookbook-second-e?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785888632), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Python is one of the leading open source platforms for data science and numerical computing. IPython and the associated Jupyter Notebook offer efficient interfaces to Python for data analysis and interactive visualization, and they constitute an ideal gateway to the platform.

IPython Interactive Computing and Visualization Cookbook, Second Edition contains many ready-to-use, focused recipes for high-performance scientific computing and data analysis, from the latest IPython/Jupyter features to the most advanced tricks, to help you write better and faster code. You will apply these state-of-the-art methods to various real-world examples, illustrating topics in applied mathematics, scientific modeling, and machine learning.

The first part of the book covers programming techniques: code quality and reproducibility, code optimization, high-performance computing through just-in-time compilation, parallel computing, and graphics card programming. The second part tackles data science, statistics, machine learning, signal and image processing, dynamical systems, and pure and applied mathematics.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
>>> print("Hello world!")
Hello world!
```

This book is accessible to beginners. However, it may be easier for you if you are familiar with the contents of Learning IPython for Interactive Computing and Data Visualization, Second Edition, Packt Publishing (also called the "IPython minibook"), the prequel of this book. The minibook introduces Python programming, the IPython console, the Jupyter Notebook, numerical computing with NumPy, basic data analysis with pandas, and plotting with
Matplotlib. This book tackles scienti fi c programming topics that rely on all of these tools. Part 2 is a bit more theoretical. It is easier to read if you know the basics of calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory (real-valued functions, integrals and derivatives, differential equations, matrices, vector spaces, probabilities, random variables, and so on). These chapters introduce different topics in data science and applied mathematics, and how
to apply them with Python: statistics, machine learning, numerical optimization, signal processing, dynamical systems, graph theory, and others.
Installing Python
This book uses the free Anaconda distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/download/). It includes Python 3, IPython, Jupyter, and almost all of the packages that we will be using in this book. Anaconda also includes a powerful packaging system named Conda. The introduction of this book's fi rst chapter gives you more details.
The code of this book has been written for Python 3 and is incompatible with older versions of Python, Python 2 (although minimal to no changes would be required to make it compatible).
GitHub repositories
This book has a website: http://ipython-books.github.io. The text, the code, and the data from the book are available on several GitHub repositories at https://github.com/ipython-books/. You can also run the code interactively in your web browser without installing anything on your computer, thanks to the Binder project.
Be sure to check out http://ipython-books.github.io and the repositories to get the latest updates and corrections. You can also propose your own corrections and suggestions on GitHub by opening issues or pull requests.
